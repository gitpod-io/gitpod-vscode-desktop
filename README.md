# Gitpod

Gitpod is an open-source Kubernetes application for automated and ready-to-code development environments that blends in your existing workflow. It enables you to describe your dev environment as code and start instant and fresh development environments for each new task directly from your browser.

Tightly integrated with GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket, Gitpod automatically and continuously prebuilds dev environments for all your branches. As a result, team members can instantly start coding with fresh, ephemeral and fully-compiled dev environments - no matter if you are building a new feature, want to fix a bug or do a code review.

## Getting Started

You can open a Gitpod workspace with VS Code Desktop in two different ways:
- From your [user preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences), you can select `VS Code Desktop` as your prefered IDE and you will always start your workspaces automatically with it.
- Ad hoc, from within VS Code Browser, by opening the Command Pallete (<kbd>F1</kbd>) and searching for <kbd>Open in VS Code</kbd> if you already have a running workspace already.

## Settings Sync

Sync your local VS Code settings across all your Gitpod workspaces. Checkout the documentation for [how to enable it](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/settings-sync#enabling-settings-sync-in-vs-code-desktop).
