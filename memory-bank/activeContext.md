# Active Context

*This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.*

## Current Focus

- **Initial Repository Analysis:** Analyzing the existing codebase (`gitpod-vscode-desktop`) to understand its structure, functionality, and integration points.
- **Memory Bank Population:** Updating the Cline Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) with the findings from the analysis.

## Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Updates (In Progress):**
    - Updated `projectbrief.md` with core requirements, goals, and scope based on code analysis.
    - Updated `productContext.md` with problem statement, target audience, high-level workflow, and UX goals.
    - Updated `systemPatterns.md` with architecture overview, key decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical paths.
    - Updated `techContext.md` with technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies, and tool usage.

## Next Steps

- Update `progress.md` to reflect the current state of the project based on the analysis.
- Complete the initial Memory Bank population task.
- Await further instructions or tasks from the user.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Connection Methods:** The extension supports two distinct SSH connection methods (Local Proxy via IPC/Supervisor API keys, and SSH Gateway via user keys/owner token). Understanding the trade-offs and configuration for each is important.
- **External Dependencies:** The reliance on `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh` for the final connection step and the requirement for the companion `gitpod.gitpod-remote-ssh` extension remotely are key architectural points.
- **SSH Configuration:** The local proxy method actively modifies the user's SSH configuration, which is a significant side effect.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Code is organized into distinct services for different concerns (Session, Host, Remote, Telemetry, etc.).
- **Dual Connection Strategy:** Explicit implementation of two connection paths (Local Proxy, Gateway).
- **IPC for Secure Data Transfer:** Using gRPC/ConnectRPC for IPC between the extension and the proxy script to handle sensitive data like temporary SSH keys.
- **Leveraging VS Code APIs:** Strong preference for using built-in VS Code APIs (Authentication, Remote Development, UI) where possible.

## Learnings & Insights

- The extension acts primarily as a sophisticated orchestrator and configuration manager, setting up the parameters and environment for the `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh` extension to perform the actual connection.
- The Local SSH Proxy method is complex, involving SSH config modification, helper scripts, IPC, and interaction with the Gitpod Supervisor API for temporary keys.
- The extension does *not* manage the VS Code Server binary on the remote host.
- Authentication relies on VS Code's built-in provider and Gitpod's Public/Supervisor APIs.
