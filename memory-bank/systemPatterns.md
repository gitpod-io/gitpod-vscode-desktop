# System Patterns

*This file documents the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.*

## System Architecture

- High-level overview of the system's structure.
- Include diagrams (e.g., Mermaid) if helpful.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Record significant architectural or technical choices made.
- Explain the reasoning behind these decisions.

## Design Patterns

- List the major design patterns employed in the codebase.
- Provide examples of their usage.

## Component Relationships

- Describe how different parts of the system interact.
- Detail dependencies between components.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- Highlight key workflows or data flows within the system.
