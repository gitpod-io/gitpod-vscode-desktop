# Progress

*This file tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.*

## What Works

Based on the code structure and implementation details observed:

- **Authentication:** Integration with VS Code's Authentication API for Gitpod login appears functional.
- **Workspace Listing & Management:** Commands and UI elements for listing, refreshing, stopping, and deleting workspaces via the Gitpod Public API seem implemented.
- **SSH Gateway Connection:** The logic for connecting via the SSH gateway (fetching host keys, checking user keys, falling back to owner token password) is present and appears to be the primary, stable connection method.
- **Local SSH Proxy Connection (Experimental):** The infrastructure for the local proxy method (SSH config modification, helper scripts, IPC server, Supervisor API interaction for temp keys) is implemented, but likely marked as experimental or behind a feature flag.
- **Integration with Remote-SSH:** Hand-off to `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh` via `vscode.openFolder` is implemented.
- **UI:** Activity Bar view, commands, and status bar elements are defined in `package.json` and likely functional.
- **Basic Configuration:** Handling of `gitpod.host` and other extension settings is implemented.
- **Telemetry & Logging:** Basic infrastructure for telemetry (`@segment/analytics-node`) and logging (`vscode.LogOutputChannel`) is in place.
- **Companion Extension Setup:** Logic exists to ensure `gitpod.gitpod-remote-ssh` is added to default remote extensions.

## What's Left to Build

- Based on this initial analysis, the core features seem implemented. Further work might involve:
    - Bug fixes and stability improvements.
    - Enhancements to existing features (e.g., more detailed workspace information, improved error handling).
    - Maturing the Local SSH Proxy connection method if it's still experimental.
    - Addressing any TODOs or planned features not evident from this high-level review.
    - Keeping dependencies (APIs, libraries, VS Code version) up-to-date.

## Current Status

- **Initial Analysis Complete:** The codebase has been analyzed at a high level to understand its structure and core functionality.
- **Memory Bank Populated:** The core Memory Bank files have been updated with the findings of this analysis.
- **Functionality:** The extension appears to be functional for its primary purpose: connecting VS Code Desktop to Gitpod Classic workspaces, primarily via the SSH Gateway method, with an experimental Local Proxy option.

## Known Issues

- No specific bugs were identified during this high-level analysis. Potential areas for issues could include:
    - Edge cases in SSH configuration parsing or modification (Local Proxy).
    - Network reliability issues affecting API calls or connections.
    - Compatibility problems with specific SSH client versions or configurations.
    - Errors during the IPC communication for the Local Proxy.
    - Issues related to the companion extension (`gitpod.gitpod-remote-ssh`).

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Introduction of Local SSH Proxy:** The addition of the complex Local SSH Proxy method alongside the more straightforward SSH Gateway method represents a significant evolution, likely aimed at improving connection reliability in restricted network environments and potentially enhancing security by using temporary, session-specific SSH keys obtained from the Supervisor API instead of relying solely on long-lived user keys or tokens passed as passwords.
- **Dependency on `ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh`:** The decision to leverage the existing Remote-SSH extension instead of building a custom remote file system and terminal backend was likely an early, foundational decision to reduce complexity and benefit from VS Code's mature remote infrastructure.
- **Companion Remote Extension:** The requirement for `gitpod.gitpod-remote-ssh` suggests a shift towards handling some logic within the remote environment itself after the connection is established.
